On GNU-Linux systems, (GNU) core utilities (i.e. 'core utils') are tools considered essential enough that they are on every applicable operating system. You will likely become very familiar with (most of) these commands. Find a list of core utils [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_GNU_Core_Utilities_commands).
