# TUI Apps

Conventional programs written for casual users usually have a GUI / graphical user interface. Professional tools may not have a GUI, opting instead for an experience entirely on the command line. <mark>TUI</mark> (terminal user interface) apps are something in between: apps with user interfaces which exist entirely within the command line. Such tools can be a convenient way to engage interactively with files or directories without needing to leave a terminal emulator.

## Use Cases

Certain cases may be particularly amenable to a TUI experience:

- large amounts of 'messy', ad-hoc work (e.g. needing to move around, copy, delete many files and folders which don't have much inherent patterning / aren't amenable to a script or shell pattern)
- inherently 'visual' tasks (e.g. interactively visualizing disk usage / remaining space on a per-folder basis)
