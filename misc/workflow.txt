standard pattern is:

write up markdown
generate *.cast file with asciinema, demo-ing some process
convert to *.gif with gifasciinema function
import gif

---

if using fzf (or maybe other TUI / 'visual' things), you must instead:

use a terminal with the exact dimensions you want (in this case, 52x18)
record the *.cast file
use 'gifasciinema-no-dimensions' instead of 'gifasciinema'

---

for demos with KEYSTROKES:

spin up 'screenkey'
record native *.webm video
convert to gif with webm2gif function
