# `.bashrc` file

When we make changes to our shell, we often want to keep them so they will always be applied every time we open a new shell; this can be done by writing those changes to our `.bashrc` file. This file is located in the `$HOME` directory, but is, due to the preceeding `.` character in the filename.

With a `.bashrc` file, customize the shell, and keep our changes.
