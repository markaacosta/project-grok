# `sed`: the <span style="color: purple">s</span>tream <span style="color: purple">ed</span>itor

As essential as [find](find.md) and [grep](grep.md) are for *finding* and *filtering* things to `stdout`, that's how essential `sed` is for taking `stdout` (or the contents of text files) and *changing* them; just like `grep` uses [regex](regex.md) to *filter* lines, `sed` uses perl substitution strings and regex patterns to *change* lines.

## Basic example

## `sd`

Learn `sed`; it is on nearly every Unix operating system. Once you are comfortable with it, consider [sd](sd.md) instead for your personal machine. `sd` is like `sed`, but faster, more modern, and written with an (arguably) simpler and more usable syntax.
