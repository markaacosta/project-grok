goal:

create a live, version-controlled, (semi) interactive repository of knowledge on:

-bash / terminal / shell

-linux / modern unix

-scripting

-anything that relates to *nix and terminal that is useful

------

-learn markdown

-learn github flavor of markdown

-decide how to approach the overall project meta (github markdown? obsidian but hosted on github somehow? some third thing?)

-mind-map the things you'll cover

-start writing!

------

i want:

-colors / syntax highlighting

-links / whole thing should be zettelkasten-like

-graded - i want to start off extremely simple, absolute basics, and take someone entirely through all the way to complex one-liners with fzf / expansion, etc.

-opinionated - make it the way you want, emphasize what *you* think is cool / useful!

-screenshots and / or gifs, screencasts from that one site, etc.

-whole thing should be searchable somehow right on github (via 'files' or something else, links, etc.)

------

my workflow:

-markdown / live preview

-vim typing / editing

-as standard in the markdown style as possible

-github actions / hooks as are useful

-live hosting for obsidian, of you go that route

-a way to publish releases, hide working branches, etc.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

general overview pattern for information:

reasoning - 'why' of linux, terminal, etc.

shell basics - globbing, cp, mv, etc.

editing with nano

interactive - fzf, etc.

vim, superior editing - modal-ize typing just like the shell modalizes *actions* we perform on a computer
