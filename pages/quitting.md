# Quitting

In general in the shell, quitting any application is done in only one of a few ways. Try one until it works:

## \<q\> (hitting the 'q' key)

This works in a `man` page for instance:

![man-quit](../assets/man-quit.gif)

## \<ESC\> (hitting the 'Esc' key)

This works in a TODO for instance:

TODO

## ^c (hitting the 'ctrl-c' key combo)

As a catch-all, `^c` is pretty standard across applications as a way to 'cancel' or 'quit' an application or process.
